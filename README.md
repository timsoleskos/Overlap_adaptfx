A Python package for adaptive radiotherapy fractionation that optimizes dose delivery based on real-time organ-at-risk overlap measurements during treatment planning and delivery.

## Overview

This package implements adaptive fractionation algorithms that dynamically adjust radiation dose delivery based on:
- Planning scan overlap measurements  
- Prescription dose constraints
- Penalty optimization for tumor coverage vs organ sparing

The adaptive approach improves treatment outcomes by maximizing dose when overlap is small and minimizing dose when overlap is large, compared to standard uniform fractionation.

## Installation

### From Source (Development)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YoelPH/Overlap_adaptfx.git
cd Overlap_adaptfx
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

After installing the package, run the test suite or launch the Streamlit app to verify the local checkout:

```bash
pytest tests/
streamlit run app.py
```

## Evaluation and Benchmarking

This repository is kept focused on the installable package, the Streamlit app, and package tests.

Notebook-based clinical evaluation, benchmark runners, variant comparisons, generated reports, and research utilities live in the private companion workbench repository:

## Running the Streamlit App

An interactive web interface is available for computing optimal dose delivery:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have installed the package and dependencies:
```bash
pip install streamlit
```

### Launch the App
From the repository root directory, run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will start and typically open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`. If it doesn't open automatically, visit this URL manually.

### Features
The Streamlit interface provides three main functionalities:
- **Actual Fraction Calculation**: Compute optimal dose for a specific fraction given current overlap
- **Precompute Plan**: Generate decision rules for all possible overlap scenarios
- **Full Plan Calculation**: Complete adaptive fractionation plan from start to finish


## Algorithm Details

The adaptive fractionation algorithm:

1. **Models overlap uncertainty** using probability distributions
2. **Optimizes dose selection** via dynamic programming with future value estimation
3. **Ensures constraint satisfaction** for clinical safety requirements

### Penalty Function
The algorithm minimizes a penalty function that increases with:
- Higher doses when overlap is large (organ sparing)
- Lower doses when overlap is small (tumor coverage)
- Deviations from prescription dose targets
